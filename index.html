            <h2>
                Hello, my name is Patrick. 
            </h2>
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I'm reading for a masters degree in chemistry at the University of Bath.
        </p>

            This website exists for three main purposes:
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    To explain who I am.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To showcase my research.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To showcase my poetry.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            At present, I have little to show in the way of research - owing to my position as an undergraduate - but I am hoping to change this with time.
            My aim is to pursue a career in computational materials science, researching the chemistry and the physics of novel materials. Ideally, this will mean
            starting a PhD as early as autumn next year. I've always loved finding the systems that 'break the rules' or behave counterintuitively according to accepted 
            theory. Computational chemistry and the computational modelling of materials in particular, provides plenty of opportunities for me to explore and
            characterise such systems. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A fair question the reader may have at this stage is: what does poetry have to do with anything?
        </p>

        <p>
            The answer: absolutely nothing. I pen the odd verse occasionally and wanted somewhere to archive my mediocrity. <strong>Enjoy</strong>.
