            <h2>
                Hello, my name is <span style='color: #E1005C'>Patrick</span>. 
            </h2>
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I'm reading for a masters degree in <span style='color: #5988FF'>Chemistry</span> at the University of Bath.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website exists for three main purposes:
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    To explain who I am.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To showcase my research.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To showcase my poetry.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            At present, I have little to show in the way of research - owing to my position as an undergraduate - but I am hoping to change this with time.
            My aim is to pursue a career in computational materials science, researching the <span style='color: #5988FF'>chemistry</span> and the 
            <span style='color: #5988FF'>physics</span> of novel materials. Ideally, this will mean starting a PhD as early as autumn next year. 
            I've always loved finding the systems that <span style='color: #00FF9B'>'break the rules'</span> or behave counterintuitively according to 
            accepted theory. Computational chemistry and the computational modelling of materials in particular, provides plenty of opportunities for me to 
            explore and characterise such systems. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A fair question the reader may have at this stage is: what does poetry have to do with anything?
        </p>

        <p>
            The answer: absolutely nothing. I pen the odd verse occasionally and wanted somewhere to archive my mediocrity. <strong style='color: #E1005C'>Enjoy</strong>.
