        <p>
            It's good to see you old friend,<br>
            O how the time has flown,<br>
            The summer sun has come and gone and left me all alone.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have missed you dear fellow,<br>
            Far more than words can say,<br>
            For when would life without such strife be fit to greet the day?
        </p>

        <p>
            Once upon a time you know,<br>
            I might have cursed your name,<br>
            But now I see this loss of me is really just a game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Or so you say, parasite,<br>
            Don't play your games with me,<br>
            If you must win then I must lose yet still you lose with me.
        </p>
